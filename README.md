# NEURAL-STYLE-TRANSFER-FROM-SCRATCH
implements the algorithm of neural style transfer using core numpy and tensorflow as stated in research paper A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style by LEON GATYS

The purpose of this code is to make the underlying maths and concepts in this technique clear instead of making the most optimal implementation using high level libraries. Suggestions are most welcome!!
